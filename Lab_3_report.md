- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program
```
@Test
public void LongArrayTestRIP(){
  int[] input1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{5,4,3,2,1}, input1);
}
```


- An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace() {
  int[] input1 = { 3 };
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```

-The symptom, as the output of running the tests: 
![img]()

- Code before change:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}
```

- Code after change:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  int left = 0;
  int right = arr.length - 1;
  while(left < right){
    int temp = arr[left];
    arr[left] = arr[right];
    arr[right] = temp;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
}
```
- Why does the fix address the issue?
   - The issue of the original implementation is: If we have [1,2,3,4,5], the output of it is [5,4,3,4,5], which is wrongly overwriting, and while iterating, the original value have lost.
   - The fix addresses this issue, letting one variable to iterate from the beginning and the other one from the back, meet at the middle.
   - It swaps elements during each iteration.
